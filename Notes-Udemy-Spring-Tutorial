Autowiring by XML configurations
- Autowiring by Type
- Autowiring by Name
- Autowiring by Constructor
- Default Autowiring

Autowiring by annnotations
- @Autowired purely working by Type
- @Qualifier
  - XML configuration
  - Java class 
- @Resource 
  - JSR-250 based annotations (from 2006) - a annotation allowing dependency injection)
  - working by Type by default
  - @Resource(name="squirrel") working by Id to avoid ambiguity of types
  - cannot used in constructor
- @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
  - JSR-250 based annotation - init and destroy methods
  - xml-based (beans.xml) 
  - @PreDestroy only works for singleton
  - @PostConstruct works for singleton and prototype
- @Inject & @Named(value="name") 
  - JSR-330 based annotation (from 2009)
- context:component-scan
  
Three ways of Configurations  
1. Java-based
  - config class
  - @Configuration & @ComponentScan
2. annotation-based
  - @Componenet, @Service, @Repository, @Controller
3. xml-based
  - XML
