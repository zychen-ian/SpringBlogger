Autowiring by XML configurations
- Autowiring by Type
- Autowiring by Name
- Autowiring by Constructor
- Default Autowiring

Autowiring by annnotations
- @Autowired purely working by Type
- @Qualifier
  - XML configuration
  - Java class 
- @Resource 
  - JSR-250 based annotations (from 2006) - a annotation allowing dependency injection)
  - working by Type by default
  - @Resource(name="squirrel") working by Id to avoid ambiguity of types
  - cannot used in constructor
- @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy
  - JSR-250 based annotation - init and destroy methods
  - xml-based (beans.xml) 
  - @PreDestroy only works for singleton
  - @PostConstruct works for singleton and prototype
- @Inject & @Named(value="name") 
  - JSR-330 based annotation (from 2009)
- context:component-scan
  
Three ways of Configurations  
1. Java-based
  - config class
  - @Configuration & @ComponentScan
2. annotation-based
  - @Componenet, @Service, @Repository, @Controller
3. xml-based
  - XML

Working with Database
* working with MySQL
  - update password
    - SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('MyNewPass');
    - Reference: 
      - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/resetting-permissions.html
      - https://blog.dotkam.com/2007/04/10/mysql-reset-lost-root-password/    
* saving database information in a property file
* DBCP - Database Connection Pool 
  - Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool
  - a cache of database connetions maintained so that the connections can be reused when future requests to the database are required.
  - so developer don't have to worry about openning and closing the connections. Just use.
  - In connection pooling, after a connection is created, it is placed in the pool and it is used again so that a new connection does not have to be established. 
  - if all the connections are being used, a new connection is made and is added to the pool. 
  - Web-based and enterprise applications use an application server to handle connection pooling.
  
  <!-- connection pool configuration -->
	<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource"
		destroy-method="close">
		<property name="driverClassName" value="${jdbc.driver}"></property>
		<property name="url" value="${jdbc.url}"></property>
		<property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}"></property>
		<property name="username" value="${jdbc.username}"></property>
	</bean>
* JDBC Template
  - This is a tutorial of Spring JDBC Framework. When we need to interface with databases, 
    the Spring JDBC framework provides solutions to all the low-level details, 
    like open/close a connection, prepare and execute SQL statements, process exceptions and handle transactions. 
    Thus, the only thing a developer must do is just define connection parameters and specify the SQL statement to be executed.
* Named Parameter JDBC Template (for placeholders)
  - prevent SQL injection

Q&A
* if missing tx in Namespace in beans.xml, how do you deal with it?
  - In beans.xml, add attributes to tag <beans>
    - xmlns:tx="http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx"
    - xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx/spring-tx.xsd"

Spring MVC
* Set dynamic web module version to 2.5
  * 2.5 is compatible with Tomcat 6.0 which is popular in some free servers
  * we can have a web XML
* 3.* is more annotation-driven

Display data on View
* It's bad to have Java embedded in view or JSP; instead, we use expression language (EL) 
* Controller
  * HttpSession (session scope)
  * ModelAndView (request scope)
* View
  * embedded Java (NOT recommended)
    * JSP - request & session
  * expression language (EL)
    * Disadvantages - model.put("name", "<b>River<b>") where HTML tags take effects.
      * JSTL (stuff in Servlet JSP course) JSP Standard Tag Library which can safely output attributes and stuffs in JSP
      * Installation: 
        - Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/c/tld-summary.html
        - Standard Syntax: <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
        - Maven pom.xml search javax.servlet jstl
